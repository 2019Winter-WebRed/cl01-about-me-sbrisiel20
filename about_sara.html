    <h1>ALL ABOUT SARA</h1>
    <hr/>
        <p>My name is Sara I am currently a junior in highschool. I am very <b>interested</b> in learning about law and history, when I grow up I hope to become an advocacy lawayer. Helping others is a passion that I have, especially people who are in need. I want to be able to help those who are underrepreseted in society. Many classes that I am currently taking will hopefully help with my future carrer goal.My favorite movie is <i>Steal Magnolis</i></p>
        <p>I live with my mom, dad, and our two dogs, Sugar and Matilda. Though, I am the only child I have a huge family that is extremely close. My aunt, who is my moms twin, has two daughters named Valentina and Liliana who are like my sisters. They are always over or I am over their house. My abuela my mom's mom, is also over all of the time cooking classic Cuban meals.</p>
        <p>When I grow up I hope to travel to many countries. I want to learn about different cultures and different expectations in different countries. I find it facinating how some places have different ideas and customs then my country. My abuela who came from Cuba talks about many different cultural differences that she sees now being in the United States. My goal is to travel and meet new people who can show me their different dances, foods, clothing ect.</p> <blockquote>You attract the energy that you give off. Spread good vibes. Think positively. Enjoy life.</blockquote>
